<u>World's First Buddhism Banknotes</u>
</h2>

<h3 style="text-align:left;">
<p>&emsp;To honor the 2012th Journey of Harmony and celebrate good relations between Sino-Nepal, upon a consultation among the two countries the treasure Shakyamuni's Sarira and the most precious Buddhist cultural relics of the birthplace of Buddhism are about to be exhibited in China. This deep China tour, which will encompass the highest level of Buddhist rite, will last for over 5 months, will be attended by the Vice President of Nepal in person. This is the second time for Shakyamuni's Sarira to leave its homeland since its first exhibition in America ten years ago.</p>
<br>
<p>&emsp;In commemoration of this momentous event, the American Gold Coin Inc. is very honored to issue the "World First Buddhism Banknotes". The illustration on the front of the banknotes is the exquisite portrait of Shakyamuni provided by the origin of Shakyamuni, Lumbini. The back is the Chinese character for Good Fortune, featuring the calligraphy work of Zhao Puchu, reknown calligrapher and the first President of the Buddhism Association of China.</p>
<br>
<p>&emsp;The World First Buddhism Banknotes are printed and issued by the Federal Reserve Bank exclusively for the China Tour of Shakyamuni's Sarira and are viable as hard currency. These banknotes, representing a moment of historical significance, reflect the good wishes of people all over the world for a better future.</p>
